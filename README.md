# why did you this?

I just got sick and tired of censorship, ads, cookies, data collection and the same looking UI design for every site on the internet,  Meme Haven is a love letter to the golden age of the Internet.  I have big plans for Meme Haven, this is only the beginning. 
  
Meme Haven WILL NEVER have ads, collect data or have cookies. I am funding the whole project.

Much love from your local meme dealer, Hussein Ben Farkhani (berber_boi).

Dejar que el mundo sea.
